## Aim

- Set up git repo for gilded rose kata

## Reflection

- Probably shouldn't have bothered with setting up github pages, wasn't important.
- Committed without checking I could build the project
- Took a while to get rider to recognise the nunit tests
  - Rebuilt solution (rather than build)
  - Disabled Nunit3 prefilter
    - [Docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Reference__Options__Tools__Unit_Testing__NUnit.html#nunit-3)
    - Tests still work after re-enabling it
  - Not sure which of these made it work
  - No changes in source to commit
