## Aim

- Set up github pages
- Make any old trivial change

## Reflection

- Github pages was easy to set up but unclear what URL to visit to see a file
- I've used ChatGPT to create an action for an index page, unclear yet how well it will work
- I've not looked into jekyll/anything else for styling
