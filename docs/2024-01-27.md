## Aim

- Set up github pages
- Make any old trivial change

## Reflection

- Github pages was easy to set up but unclear what URL to visit to see a file
- I've used ChatGPT to create an action for an index page, unclear yet how well it will work
  - I got it working but it took longer than I'd have liked.
    - I have since discovered that it fails the PR if there are no changes to the docs index since the last update. I will need to fix this at some point.
    - As a workaround, I will manually edit the index, so the action can put it back to the correct state.
  - I used chatGPT quite heavily and I think it was successful, a lot quicker than I would expect if working from docs & stack overflow. I did make heavy use of SO as well though to debug chatGPT output.
    - This fits with my expectations that AI is more useful for a more junior dev. I was using it for stuff I'm not familiar with, so I am effectively more junior in those areas than in my day job.
- I've not looked into jekyll/anything else for styling
