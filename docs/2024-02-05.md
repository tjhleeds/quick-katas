## Timebox

20 mins

## Aim

### Minimum goal

- First proper test asserting something meaningful about the business logic.

### Ideal goal

- Somewhere in the region of 5-10 meaningful tests of business logic.

## Reflection

- Spent almost 3 mins getting codespace & markdown file set up.
- Got on well with testing.
- Made the mistake of trying to rename the project and solution, and broke my ability to run tests. Unable to get build error from test runner, dotnet rebuild seems fine. Needs further investigation next time, or revert the commit and ignore the problem.
